🌟 DevOps Project: Multi-Environment Infrastructure with Terraform and Ansible
This project automates the creation and management of infrastructure using Terraform (for provisioning) and Ansible (for configuration) across development, staging, and production environments.

🔧 Tools Used:
Terraform for provisioning infrastructure
Ansible for configuring servers (e.g., installing Nginx)
AWS as the cloud provider
🚀 Steps Overview:
Install Terraform & Ansible

Install on Ubuntu with simple commands to get started.
Create Project Folders

Organize your project into two main directories:
terraform/ for infrastructure scripts
ansible/ for server configuration
Setup Terraform Infrastructure

Define infrastructure like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and DynamoDB using .tf files.
Create Dynamic Inventories in Ansible

Automatically manage environments (dev, prod, stg) with inventory files.
Install Nginx with Ansible Playbook

Automate Nginx installation on all servers using a playbook (install_nginx_playbook.yml).
Configure Server Roles with Ansible Galaxy

Use pre-built Nginx roles from Ansible Galaxy for consistent configurations.
Automate Inventory Updates

Use a script (update_inventories.sh) to dynamically update server IPs from Terraform outputs.
💡 Key Concepts:
Terraform:

Automates cloud infrastructure (e.g., EC2, S3, DynamoDB).
Modules allow you to create reusable, environment-specific resources.
Ansible:

Automates server configuration (e.g., Nginx setup).
Playbooks define tasks to run on your servers.
📝 Final Steps:
Initialize Terraform:

terraform init – Setup providers & modules.
terraform plan – Preview infrastructure changes.
terraform apply – Deploy infrastructure.
Use Ansible Playbooks:

Run Nginx setup on servers:
ansible-playbook -i inventories/dev install_nginx_playbook.yml
Clean Up:

After testing, run terraform destroy to tear down infrastructure and avoid extra costs.

🚨 Don't Forget:
Security: Protect your private SSH key (chmod 400 devops-key).
Automation: Reduce manual work by automating infrastructure and configuration.
🎉 Outcome:
Multi-Environment Infrastructure: Easily manage dev, staging, and prod environments.
Scalable: Both Terraform and Ansible allow easy scaling of infrastructure and configuration.
Automated Setup: From provisioning EC2 instances to setting up Nginx, everything is automated!
This project gives you hands-on experience with Terraform and Ansible, providing a solid foundation in Infrastructure as Code and Configuration Management for any DevOps role. 🚀
